# Housing Price Prediction Using Regression

## Project Overview
This project explores housing data from California and applies a regression
approach to understand how geographic location influences housing prices.

## Data
The analysis uses the California Housing dataset, which contains information
about housing locations and median house values.

## Method
A tree-based regression model was used to learn relationships between geographic
features (latitude and longitude) and housing prices.

## Results
The model reveals clear spatial patterns in housing prices across California,
highlighting regional differences between northern and southern areas.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis and simple regression
models can be used to understand real-world housing price patterns.
